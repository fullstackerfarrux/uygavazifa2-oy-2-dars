          <h2>About us</h2>
          <p>
            Coffeeroasters began its journey of exotic discovery in 1999,
            highlighting stories of coffee from around the world. We have since
            been dedicated to bring the perfect cup - from bean to brew - in
            every shipment.

        <h2>Uncompromising quality</h2>
        <p>
          Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of
          harvest and processing, we employ, on our end, a rigorous quality
          control program to avoid over-roasting or baking the coffee dry. Every
          bag of coffee is tagged with a roast date and batch number. Our goal
          is to roast consistent, user-friendly coffee, so that brewing is easy
          and enjoyable.
